Inspired by (but modified a bit!) from [the Skinny Taste recipe](https://www.skinnytaste.com/skinny-baked-broccoli-macaroni-and/). I love mac and cheese and am so happy I found a way to still have it. This meal is a _little_ higher in carbs than most keto meals since the pasta has 8 net carbs per serving (4 servings per bag), but it's fantastic comfort food with minimal guilt.

## Ingredients
* 8 oz [low carb elbows from Thin Slim Foods](http://www.thinslimfoods.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=10&products_id=95)
* 1 1/2 tbsp butter
* 1/4 cup minced onion
* 1/4 cup almond flour
* 2 cups heavy cream
* 1 cup fat free chicken broth or bone broth
* 12 oz shredded sharp cheddar (16 oz if you want some on top)

1. Preheat oven to 375Â°F

4. Add heavy cream and chicken broth and whisk on medium-high until it comes to a boil. Cook for 5-10 minutes. 
5. While your sauce is cooking, start a pot for the broccoli and a pot for the pasta according to the package directions (for the pasta, once water is boiling cook pasta for 6 minutes).

7. Season sauce with salt and pepper
7. When your broccoli is done, chop up into smaller pieces

11. Bake for 15-20 minutes.
