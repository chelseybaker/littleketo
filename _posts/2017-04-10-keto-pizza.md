Keto would be impossible if I had to give up pizza üçï Cheese on cheese on cheese!
<br/><br/>

This recipe originally started with [Fathead Movie's recipe](http://www.fathead-movie.com/index.php/2013/06/30/weekend-bonus-the-older-brothers-oldest-sons-faux-carb-pizza/), but I've modified it a bit to make it bigger!

## Directions

* Parchment paper
* 16oz low moisture mozzarella (I buy blocks and shred it myself!)
* 3/4 cup almond flour
* 3oz cream cheese
* 2 eggs
* Pizza sauce (be sure to check the amount of sugar!)
* Toppings of your choice (I usually do pepperoni, bacon, chicken, and Italian sausage ü§§) 

Shred your mozzarella.

Heat oven to 425¬∞.

In a microwave safe bowl, add 8oz shredded mozzarella and the cream cheese (cutting up the cream cheese helps!). Put it in the microwave for 60 seconds, then stir, then microwave for another 30 seconds and stir again. Make sure it's pretty melted and mix in the cream cheese into the melted mozz thorougly.  

Add the almond eggs, and mix, then the almond flour and mix by stirring and folding over (I use a spatula).

Lay out your parchment paper on an oven safe pan and pour your dough onto it.

Because the consistency isn't like regular pizza dough, you won't need to knead it as much. It sort of "spreads". Wet your hands with some water because it gets sticky! Spread the dough out with your hands or spatula, keeping the thickness as even as possible (if you have really thin spots they'll burn faster than the rest of the dough can cook).

Put it in the oven for 8 minutes. 

While your dough is in the oven, prep your toppings. I use this time to cook my Italian sausage and bacon. I use shredded rotisserie chicken and uncured pepperoni. 

When the 8 minutes is up, take it out of the oven and poke with a fork all over. This will prevent bubbling. Put it back in the oven for another 5 to 8 minutes (you'll need to watch it) until it's starting to brown.

Add your sauce, cheese and toppings, then put back in the oven for about 5 minutes or until cheese is melted and bubbly to your liking! 

When you take it out, give it a couple minutes to cool off and enjoy!

If your dough isn't as stiff or is chewy, the next time you make it, leave it in the oven for longer to brown (after fork poking, before sauce and toppings).
