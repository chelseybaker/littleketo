This is pretty much my favorite thing to make (and eat) on the keto diet. I always have some in the fridge ðŸ˜¬

# Ingredients

For the crust
* 3/4 cup almond flour
* 2 tbs butter
* (Optional) 1 tsp brown sugar

For the cheesecake
* 2 8oz packages of cream cheese
* 2 eggs
* 1/2 cup stevia sweetener
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* (Optional) 1 packaged flavored sugar free getlatin (I use strawberry)


# Directions

Take your cream cheese and eggs out of the fridge about 2 hours or so before you start to make these! Your ingredients should be at room temperature, otherwise they will not blend well

Pre heat oven to 350 degrees

Line a muffin pan with 12 paper liners

Melt butter and mix with almond flour and brown sugar until crumbly.

Spoon into the bottoms of the liner and flatten. I find it's easier to dump a small spoonful into each liner and press them after so I can eyeball they all have roughly the same amount.

Put the muffin pan with crusts in the oven for about 7-9 minutes, or until they've started to brown

Beat cream cheese, eggs, sweetener, and vanilla extract together in a bowl with a hand mixer on medium speed until smooth. This will take longer if your cream cheese isn't softened enough.

**If you are adding gelatin flavoring**, add in a teaspoon at a time and blend with the mixer until you get your desired flavor (remember, you can always add more, not less ðŸ™‚ ). I usually like to make 6 regular cheesecakes and 6 flavored cheesecakes, so I will fill 6 of the cups with cheesecake mix, and then add in about 2 teaspoons of gelatin and blend with the hand mixer, then fill the remaining cups.

Bake until your cheesecake is set in the middle, about 15-17 minutes. It's "set" when it is slightly puffed and the center should be a little shiny and ever so slightly jiggly. If the center doesn't shake, or especially if it cracked, it's over cooked (I've done this before, and they're still delicious, just not as soft in the center).

Bring the cheesecakes out of the oven and let cool until room temperature, then refrigerate overnight. You'll probably want to test one for breakfast, just to make sure they're good before serving ðŸ˜‰
