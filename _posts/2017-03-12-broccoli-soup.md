## Directions

* 3 tbsp butter
* 1/2 chopped onion
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 2 cups chicken broth
* 16oz bag frozen broccoli florets
* 1/2 tsp paprika
* Pinch of cayenne (optional)
* 1 cup heavy cream
* 2 cups sharp shredded cheddar cheese
* Salt & pepper to taste

In a large pot, cook broccoli in boiling water (or according to package directions). Dump into a colander when soft. If you like smaller broccoli bits (like me), once the broccoli has cooled off slightly, I chop it up with a large knife right in the colonder. (If you're using fresh broccoli, you can do this beforehand)

While your broccoli is softening, melt the butter in a sautÃ©, then add garlic and onion until soft. Add broth.

Mix seasonings with heavy cream and cheddar cheese into broth mix. I added about a 1/2 cup of the cheese at a time and waited until each batch melted before adding more. Let it simmer for awhile until thick and completely mixed.

Pour over your broccoli and stir! 

I usually get 4 to 5 bowls out of this. You can freeze your leftovers in individual containers and just microwave when you're ready to eat ðŸ˜¬ ðŸ§€
