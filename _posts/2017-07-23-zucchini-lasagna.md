Inspired by (but modified a bit!) from [the Skinny Taste recipe](http://www.skinnytaste.com/zucchini-lasagna/), this keto lasagna is delicious! It takes quite awhile to make but you could prep it the day before and cook the next day!

### Time

Prep: 60 minutes

Cook: 50 minutes

Total: About 2ish hours from start to finish

## Directions

* 1lb ground beef (your choice! I used ground sirloin)
* Olive oil (or your choice of cooking oil)
* 3 cloves garlic
* 1/3 cup chopped onion
* 28oz can crushed tomatos
* 2tbsp basil (the original recipe calls for chopped fresh basil, I use a spice container)
* 2-3 large zucchini, 1/8th inch thick (sliced with [a mandoline](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000632QE/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_dp_T2_C5qDzbG19CPJ4), this is a must), cut to fit a 9x13 dish. You'll need about 20-24 slices (however many will make 4 layers)
* 12-15 ounces part-skim ricotta
* 1/4 cup parmesean
* 1 large egg
* 16 oz shredded low moisture mozzarella cheese

The first two steps are taken directly from the Skinny Taste recipe: 

* (From Skinny Taste) In a medium sauce pan, brown meat and season with salt. When cooked drain in colander to remove any fat.
* (From Skinny Taste) Add olive oil to the pan and saute garlic and onions about 2 minutes. Return the meat to the pan, add tomatoes, basil, salt and pepper. Simmer on low for at least 30-40minutes, covered. Do not add extra water, the sauce should be thick.
* Heat your oven to 250 degrees. Slice your zucchini with [a mandoline](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000632QE/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_dp_T2_C5qDzbG19CPJ4). Place a paper towel on a cookie tray and layer the zucchini slices. Add a little bit of salt to each layer, then cover with a paper towel and layer the next round of zucchini slices. Cook for 10 minutes, flip them over (careful, the paper towels can be quite warm when they're wet!), and cook for another 10 minutes. Soak up any leftover water
* Preheat oven to 375 degrees
* (From Skinny Taste) In a medium bowl mix ricotta cheese, parmesan cheese and egg. Stir well.
* Layer your lasagna!

You should have 4 sets in the following order (so 16 total layers): 

1. Sauce
2. Zucchini layer
3. Cottage cheese mix
4. Mozzarella cheese

* Spray some foil with Pam and cover with foil and bake for 35 minutes. Uncover the foil and bake for another 25 minutes 
* Let stand about 5-10 minutes before serving
