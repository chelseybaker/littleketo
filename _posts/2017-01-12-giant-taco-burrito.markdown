A giant keto taco is all the ingredients of a supreme taco in a low carb burrito tortilla! 
This makes four large servings because of the tortillas size. I've used a head of lettuce to make lettuce boats instead of the tortilla to lower the calories, but that'll be another recipe!

There is more protein than fat in this because of the ground turkey. In the future I'll probably switch to a fattier meat.

# Ingredients

* 1.5 lbs ground turkey
* 1 and 1/2 packets Ortega Taco Seasoning
* 12 ounces Colby Jack cheese, shredded (I prefer to get blocks and shred it myself)
* 2 Roma tomatoes
* 4 tbs Daisy sour cream
* 4 Mission Carb Balance Whole Wheat Burrito Tortillas
 

# Directions

Cook the turkey according to the directions on the seasoning packet

Cut up lettuce, dice the tomatoes, and shred the cheese while your meat cooks

In a saut√© pan big enough to fit your tortilla, warm one side of it on medium heat

Remove tortilla and place the warmed side up on a plate

Layer shredded cheese and then meat, lettuce, sour cream, a taco sauce, or any other ingredients you might like

Carefully place the tortilla with toppings into the pan, leaving it open (or, if you can, wrap it into a burrito style and place folded side down)

Let the cheese melt until desired, remove, fold, and eat!
